## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It's been a while since I coded anything without a framework. For this, I relied heavily on Flexbox to set the layouts, starting with the mobile view.  For the header image, I leveraged background-blend-mode:multiply, which resulted in a slightly richer tone compared to the comp - overall I think it was an improvement.  Leveraging the background-image property did leave me without the option to include alt-text, but for this situation, the image is purely decorative.

### Continued development

Ideally, this would have been a great chance to use CSS Grid. I think this may have been a better way to handle the image alignment.  I used my best judgment on the padding since I did not have access to the Figma files. I also used pixel values where ideally I would use rems.  I also used longhand notation on the background and flexbox properties, in a production environment I would condense those down.  

### Useful resources
